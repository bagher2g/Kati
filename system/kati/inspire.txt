The Earth would die If the sun stopped kissing her.
For I have learned that every heart will get What it prays for Most.
The heart is a The thousand-stringed instrument That can only be tuned with Love.
I should not make any promises right now, But I know if you Pray Somewhere in this world - Something good will happen.
Listen: this world is the lunatic's sphere, Don't always agree it's real, Even with my feet upon it And the postman knowing my door My address is somewhere else.
All your wounds from craving love Exist because of heroic deeds.
